		<h2>Illumination</h2>
		<p>In tutorial 2, we have seen the use of ambient lighting to illuminate our renderables. The ambient lighting sources is controlled with the <b>setGlobalAmbientIntensity()</b> function. This source is always active and it adjusts the lighting on all renderables in our scene. If we want to disable the light, we set the intensity to 0. The lighting affect is analagous to increasing the backlight intensity on your cell phone or laptop. Everything gets &quot;brightened&quot; by the same amount.</p>
		<p>The game engine supports 3 other types of light sources.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Point - An omnidirectional light source in space. Similar to a hovering firefly with a &quot;sphere of illumination&quot; wherever it goes.</li>
		  <li>Spot - A cone-shaped light source directed at a location. Similar to a flashlight pointing at a wall.</li>
		  <li>Directional - A planar light source where light is equally intense at all incident points. Similar to the screen backlight of electronics devices.</li>
		  </ul>
        <p>These different lighting types have are declared using a number of parameters sent into the Proper use of lighting requires...</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>Declare a light source with the type and parameters defining it's characteristics.</li>
            <li>Idenfity to each applicable renderable that it should account for the light source when drawing itself.</li>
          </ol>
		<p class="note">[Note: This second requirement may seem odd but lighting calculations are essentially a manipulation of how pixels are drawn to the screen (how the object looks). Since we are familiar with the fact that the &quot;look&quot; of game elements is under the purview of the renderable, we treat lighting as a parameter we add to the renderable object.]</p>
    <h3>Point Lights</h3>
    <p>A point light has intensity, color, position</p>
    <h3>Spot Lights</h3>
    <p>In tutorial 2, we have seen the use of ambient l</p>
    <h3>Directional Lights</h3>
		<p>A directional light is similar to ambient light in that every pixel illunated by it receives the light with equal intensity. However, while the ambient light source allows us to set just the intensity, we can also define direction and color for directional light sources. Since we are dealing with two dimensional renderables, the direction of the light is not going to provide a sense of depth like it would in three dimensional space. We ignore the directional component for now and set the intensity and color using <code>setLightColor()</code> and <code>setLightIntensity()</code>.</p>
